![Model of dynastic effects used in these simulations](../images/dynastic-01.png)


## Simulation of genotypes

Create $n$ mothers and fathers. They are unrelated. Each mother-father pair has 2 children. All individuals have genomes of 90 SNPs. Calculate IBD at each locus for each sibling pair. The distribution of IBD across the 90 SNPs is $N(\mu = 0.5, \sigma=0.037)$, as per theory, because there are on average 90 recombination events separating siblings. Hence, we are assuming each SNP has an effect and that all effects are independent.

## Dynastic effects on phenotype

See Figure 1. Parents have confounders $u$, exposure $x$ and outcome $y$ phenotypes. The confounder influences $x$ and $y$ by some effect $\beta_{ux}, \beta_{uy}$, and $x$ influences $y$ with $\beta_{xy}$.

The children have the same setup, except the parent's $x$ values influence the children's $u$ values also, with effect $\beta_{xu}$. This represents the dynastic effect.

The genetic influence of each of the 90 SNPs on $x$ amounts to explaining $V_{gx}$ of the variance in $x$. There is no pleiotropy.

## Statistical models

### Standard MR

Use just one sibling from each family and perform MR as usual using IVW. This involves obtaining the SNP-exposure association for each of the 90 SNPs; the SNP-outcome association for each of the 90 SNPs, and estimating the slope underlying the relationship using inverse squared standard errors for weights.

### Within-family $D^2$

The SNP-exposure estimates are performed within family. e.g. For SNP j

$$
(x_{i1} - x_{i2})^2 = \beta_{xj} \hat{\pi}_{ij} + e_{ij}
$$

and similarly the SNP-outcome estimates are obtained as

$$
(y_{i1} - y_{i2})^2 = \beta_{yj} \hat{\pi}_{ij} + e_{ij}
$$

The $\beta_{xj}$ and $\beta_{yj}$ estimates are then used in a standard IVW framework to obtain the causal effect.

### Within-family $S^2$

Identical to the $D^2$ except the LHS of the equation is replaced with $(y_{i1} + y_{i2})^2$.


### Within-family $D^2 + S^2$

Following from Visscher and Hopper 2001 this approximates the maximum likelihood estimate of the within-family linkage analysis by meta-analysing the $D^2$ and $S^2$ results of each SNP-exposure and SNP-outcome estimate. The results are subsequently used to estimate the causal effect in the standard IVW framework.

$$
\begin{aligned}
w &= \frac{\frac{1}{v_D}}{\frac{1}{v_D} + \frac{1}{v_S}} \\
b_{DS} &= \frac{1}{2}((1 - w) b_S - w b_D) \\
v_{DS} &= \frac{1}{4} w v_D
\end{aligned}
$$

### Hybrid

Here the effect estimates for the SNP-exposure association are obtained externally (e.g. from a GWAS). In the case of the simulations, they are obtained from estimating $x = \beta_{xj} g + e$ using the fathers' simulated data. A weighted genetic difference between siblings is then obtained:

$$
\delta_{x_g,j} = \hat{\beta}_xj g_{i_1, j} - \hat{\beta}_xj g_{i_2, j}
$$

The SNP's influence on the relationship between sibling genotypic difference and exposure difference is then obtained by regression:

$$
(x_{i1} - x_{i2})^2 = \beta_{xj} \delta_{x_g,j} + e_{ij}
$$

and similarly for the outcome

$$
(y_{i1} - y_{i2})^2 = \beta_{yj} \delta_{x_g,j} + e_{ij}
$$

The $\hat{\beta}_{yj}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{xj}$ estimates are then used in a standard IVW framework.


## Results

All estimates based on $V_{GX} = 0.1$ and 90 independent causal variants (i.e. somewhat similar to BMI with latest GIANT results).

1. The standard MR estimate has high power for detecting association, but when confounding and dynastic effects are large there is an extremely high false discovery rate
2. The within-family methods have extremely low power
3. The hybrid approach appears to be well powered and with low FDR for the null model with dynastic effects. Also shows little bias in these simulations.
4. Trio method is comparable to hybrid, with slightly better power when sample sizes are smaller
5. The use of IBD, IBS and unweighted IBS are largely identical


```{r }

load("../results/sib_dynastic.rdata")

dat$test <- as.factor(dat$test)
levels(dat$test) <- c("Standard MR", "D2 ~ IBD", "S2 ~ IBD", "VH model", "Hybrid", "Trios")
dat$b[dat$test %in% c("Hybrid", "Standard MR", "Trios")] <- dat$b[dat$test %in% c("Hybrid", "Standard MR", "Trios")]^2
dat$se[dat$test %in% c("Hybrid", "Standard MR", "Trios")] <- dat$se[dat$test %in% c("Hybrid", "Standard MR", "Trios")]^2

```

Is there a difference in method performance based on whether IBD, IBS or unweighted IBS is used?

```{r}
# IBD, IBS, IBS_unw
dat$sig <- dat$pval < 0.05
group_by(dat, test, eff_xy == 0) %>% summarise(
	sig = summary(lm(sig ~ gen))$coef[2,4]
) %>% kable

```

```{r}

pow <- filter(dat) %>% group_by(n, vargx, eff_xy, eff_ux, eff_xu, model, test) %>%
	dplyr::summarise(
		se=sd(b, na.rm=TRUE),
		b=mean(b, na.rm=TRUE),
		pow=sum(pval < 0.05)/n(),
		nsim=n()
	)
